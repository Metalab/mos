Install docker and docker-compose on your host OS (example for Debian/Ubuntu):

    sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose

Then, build and run the Docker image:

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --service-ports mos

After it is up and running, point your web browser to:

    http://localhost:8020/
