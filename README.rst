Metalab OS
==========

About
-----

This is the django project that runs our web site at the Metalab hackerspace
in Vienna, Austria (https://metalab.at/).

The official source repository and bug tracker as of 2012-03-21 can be
found at: https://github.com/Metalab/mos .

Development in this project will mainly focus on features that are useful to
us locally. If you are interested in a "generalised" version, we are very much
interested in talking to you!
